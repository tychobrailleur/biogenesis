Biogenesis is an artificial life program that simulates the processes involved
in the evolution of organisms. It shows colored segment based organisms that
mutate and evolve in a 2D environment. Biogenesis is based on Primordial Life.

This repo contains my[fn:1] own changes to the Biogenesis source code.
See http://biogenesis.sourceforge.net/ for original application.

* Changes

  Changes to the original application include:

  - Mavenized project :: it is now much easier to build and release Biogenesis,
  - Family tree :: it is possible to view the ancestors of a given
                   organism,
  - Music :: organisms can now make sounds when colliding,
  - Scripting :: JRuby scripts can be used to extend Biogenesis,
  - Several UI improvements,
  - etc.

* Building

  Maven is required to build this project.

  You must first ensure that the =jfugue= dependency is installed in
  your local Maven repository by running the following command at the
  root of your project:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
mvn initialize
#+END_SRC

  Once this is done, the project can be packaged by running the
  following command:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
mvn package
#+END_SRC

  This creates a JAR file in the =target/= directory which can be
  executed directly.
